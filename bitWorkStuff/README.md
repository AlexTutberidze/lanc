Each byte is 2 letters. We can have a maximum of 4 bytes (8 letters). Depending on how many bytes we have, different number of bits (each byte has 8 bits) will be reserved for the whole part (which they call exponent) and for fractional part
First bit is used to find out if number is positive or negative (0 means positive, 1 means negative)
