Create multi-threaded guessing game. The program should take two parameters: -n â€“ size of a vector
and -t number of threads. Main program creates and initializes a vector of size n with zeros. The main
thread creates t worker threads which share the vector. The main thread awaits signals. On SIGINT (C-
c) it puts a random positive non zero value [1, 255] to random position in the vector.
GUESSED_VALUE is an integer that is shared among all threads initialized with zero. On SIGUSR1 it
prints a value GUESSED_VALUE, then cancels a random thread. On SIGQUIT (C-\) it cancels all
threads and quits. Moreover, the main thread prints the entire vector to stdout every 500ms.
Each worker thread works in a loop. It chooses random value from the vector. If it is zero, do nothing.
If it is equal to GUESSED_VALUE then send SIGUSR1 to current process. If it is any other positive
non zero value then set GUESSED_VALUE equal to it. Then the thread sleeps for 1 second.
Vector operations and operations on GUESSED_VALUE should be synchronized with two different
mutexes. Mutexes should be locked and unlocked properly considering the thread cancel functionality.
